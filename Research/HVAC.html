        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Neural radiance fields (NeRF) encode a scene into a neural representation that enables photo-realistic rendering of novel views. However, a successful reconstruction from RGB images requires a large number of input views taken under static conditions—typically up to a few hundred images for room-size scenes, and the prediction of volume density is usually not as accurate as the RGB, which leads to ghostly artifact issues. To address this issue, a metric depth learning module is incorporated with the classic NeRF framework to leverage the depth prior for faster training speed and better rendering quality.</p>
