<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year Master's student in Mechanical Engineering with a foucus on Robotics at Columbia University. Before entering Columbia, I earned B.Eng. from Xi'an Jiaotong University.

My research interest lies at the intersection of robotics, optimal control, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
